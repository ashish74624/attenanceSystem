# Student-Attendance-Management-System
Student attendance management system for the browser using face recognition on video input from user's webcam with face-api.js by @justadudewhohacks (JavaScript face recognition API for the browser and nodejs implemented on top of tensorflow.js core, more details can be found here https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/)
This is a MERN stack web development project that builds on my previous work in https://github.com/jolwnn/Student-Attendance-Management-System.

You can test SAMS with images of Harry, Hermione, and Ron from Harry Potter, or by putting your own photos in. Note: You will have to set up your own MongoDB database and connect to it in the server.js file.
